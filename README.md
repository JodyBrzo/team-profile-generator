# team-profile-generator

A Test Driven Development CLI application using Node.js that takes input from the user, in this case a team manager, about employees on a software engineering team. Once the team amanager is finished entering in the names, ID's, email's and GitHub porfiles the application generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

# Usage
Check out my [video tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLhwt3h8qn8FRw5GLdpBcWHgp3lmGW4q/view) for a complete walkthrough of this app and you can view a sample HTML here [sample Team Profile ](https://github.com/JodyBrzo/readme-generator/blob/main/README-SAMPLE.md)

Once the app is running the terminal will ask you a series of questions.  The first set of questions is about the manager.  When you are done with your input then you will be asked to enter information for a engineer, intern or of you are done buiding your team. You will keep returning to this menu after each employee you add until you select that you are done building your team, at that point the app generates a HTML page with all of your teams information.
